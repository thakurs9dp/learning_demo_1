// 1. Accessibility Enhancements

//A : - Android 14 now allows users to increase the font size up to 200%.
// This is a great improvement for people with low vision,
// as it makes it easier to read text on their screens


// 2. Core Functionality Improvements

//A. Android 14 includes a number of core functionality
// improvements that will make your apps more secure, efficient,
// and user-friendly. Here are a few of the highlights

// More Control Over Background Processes
// - Apps can‚Äôt mess with other apps background stuff anymore. This keeps your phone running smoother and saves battery because rogue background apps can be a pain.


// Exact Alarms Permission Changes
// Apps can‚Äôt set alarms without asking permission SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM. It‚Äôs like asking for permission to wake you up in the morning. This is good for privacy and your battery life.


//Broadcasts and Cached Apps
//Context-registered broadcasts are now queued when apps are in a cached state, ensuring smoother operation.
//
//Foreground Service Types Requirement
//Apps in Android 14 have to say why they need to run in the foreground. So, if you‚Äôre playing music in the background, you‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm using Audio to play tunes!‚Äù This helps you know which apps are using your phone‚Äôs juice. üéµ
